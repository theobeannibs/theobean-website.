            <h2>A Chain of Trust, Not a Supply Chain</h2>
            <p>Born from a family story of injustice, Theobean was created to build a direct bridge from the grove to the global market. We use technology to ensure value stays where it belongs: with the source. This is more than fair trade; it's economic sovereignty.</p>

            <h2>The Founder's Ledger</h2>
            <p>Our first supporters are the bedrock of this mission. The Founder's Ledger is a permanent, digital monument to the patrons and allies who helped bring Theobean to life. Their names are inscribed as a testament to their belief in a more equitable future.</p>
